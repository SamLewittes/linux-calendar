Project Description:

I developed a calendar program for linux that allows users to add upcoming events to their schedule, and get notifications to remind them of those events. 

Users will first be able to create an account or log in if they have an existing account. They will then have the ability to add events to their calendar featuring a command line display of the current year. These events include a name, date, and time and they can specify flags to repeat the event on a day, week, month, or year basis. Events are stored in a text file acting as a database. Users will have the ability to search through their calendar by entering event names, along with dates. They can also see the events coming up for the next week. Finally, users can enter their email and receive weekly email updates on their upcoming events.
